## What is Tab Flow?

Ever find yourself drowning in browser tabs? We've all been there. You've got 30+ tabs open, and finding that one page you need feels like searching for a needle in a haystack.

**Tab Flow** changes that. It's a beautiful, lightning-fast tab switcher that gives you two powerful ways to navigate:

- **Quick Switch (`Alt + Q`)** – Instant Alt+Tab style switching. Just hold Alt, tap Q to cycle, and release Alt to switch. No typing required.
- **Tab Flow with Search (`Alt + W`)** – A visual overlay with live thumbnails, search, and powerful keyboard navigation.

No more squinting at tiny favicons. No more clicking through endless tabs. Just press a shortcut and you're there.

## Why You'll Love It

### 🎯 **Find Any Tab in Seconds**

Start typing and Tab Flow instantly filters your tabs by title or URL. Looking for that GitHub PR? Just type "github" and there it is.

### ⚡ **Quick Switch Like Alt+Tab**

Press `Alt + Q` for instant tab switching – just like Windows Alt+Tab. Hold Alt, tap Q to cycle through tabs, release Alt to switch. It's that fast.

### 👀 **See What's Actually Open**

Each tab shows a live thumbnail preview, so you can visually spot the page you're looking for. No more guessing which "Google Docs" tab is the right one.

### ⚡ **Stupidly Fast**

Opens in under 100ms. Seriously. We obsess over performance so you don't have to wait.

### 🎨 **Looks Great Everywhere**

Clean, modern design that automatically adapts to light and dark themes. Uses glassmorphism effects that look stunning without being distracting.

### 🔊 **Control Your Audio**

See which tabs are playing sound at a glance. Mute that random YouTube video without hunting for it.

### 📂 **Tab Groups? We Got You**

If you use Chrome's tab groups, they're displayed beautifully with collapsible headers and color coding.

## How It Works

Tab Flow is built with performance and privacy in mind:

- **Manifest V3** – Uses Chrome's latest extension platform for better security and performance
- **Service Worker** – Captures tab screenshots and manages state efficiently in the background
- **Shadow DOM** – The overlay is completely isolated from web pages, so it looks perfect everywhere
- **LRU Cache** – Smart caching keeps memory usage under control, even with 100+ tabs
- **Virtual Scrolling** – Handles large tab counts smoothly at 60fps

### Tech Stack

- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite + CRXJS for blazing fast builds
- IndexedDB for persistent caching
- No external dependencies for the core functionality

## Privacy

**Your data stays on your device. Period.**

Tab Flow stores tab thumbnails and metadata locally to power the tab switching experience. Here's what we want you to know:

- ✅ **No data leaves your browser** – Everything is stored locally in IndexedDB
- ✅ **No analytics or tracking** – We don't collect usage data
- ✅ **No accounts required** – Just install and use
- ✅ **Open source** – You can see exactly what the code does

For the legal stuff, check out our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md).

## FAQ

**Q: Why does it need access to all websites?**  
A: To capture tab screenshots and show the overlay on any page you're viewing. We don't read or store your browsing data – just take screenshots for the preview tiles.

**Q: Does it work on Chrome internal pages?**  
A: Chrome doesn't allow extensions to inject content on `chrome://` pages. On these pages, Tab Flow opens as a popup window instead. Same functionality, different container.

**Q: Can I change the keyboard shortcut?**  
A: Yes! Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` and set whatever key combo you prefer.

**Q: How much memory does it use?**  
A: We cap screenshot cache at ~20MB. With typical usage (30 tabs), expect around 15-25MB of memory usage.

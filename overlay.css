/* Visual Tab Switcher - Shadow DOM Styles Reference */
/* ============================================================================
 * IMPORTANT: This file is kept for reference only.
 * 
 * All styles are embedded directly in the Shadow DOM via SHADOW_CSS in content.js.
 * This ensures complete style encapsulation and prevents any CSS from leaking
 * into the host page.
 * 
 * DO NOT inject this file into web pages as it would affect the host page layout.
 * The Shadow DOM in content.js handles all styling isolation automatically.
